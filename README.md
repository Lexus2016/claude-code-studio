## What is this?

Claude Code CLI is Anthropic's AI that writes code, runs commands, edits files, and ships features — not just talks about them. It's genuinely powerful.

The problem: it lives in your terminal. And the terminal has limits.

**Context gets lost.** Switch projects, and you lose your place. Come back tomorrow and you're scrolling through history to remember where you were.

**Parallel work is painful.** Want Claude working on three things at once? That means three terminal tabs, three sessions, three things to manage manually.

**No visibility.** Queue five tasks and walk away. Two hours later — which ones finished? Which ones failed? You're reading scrollback to find out.

**Screenshots and files are clunky.** "Look at this error" means uploading an image somewhere, getting a URL, pasting it. It works, but it's friction.

Claude Code Studio is the missing interface. You open it in your browser, and your AI starts working.

## Terminal vs Web UI

![Workflow comparison](public/screenshots/workflow-comparison.png)

The difference isn't just visual. A web interface changes how you think about delegating work to AI — from one-off prompts to a queue of managed tasks.

---

## What it actually does

### 💬 Chat that does things

Not a chatbot. When you type "refactor this function and add tests", Claude opens files, edits them, runs the tests, fixes errors, and reports back — in real time, right in the chat. Paste a screenshot with Ctrl+V and Claude sees it.

### 📋 Kanban board for your AI tasks

Create a card. Describe what you want. Move it to "To Do". Claude picks it up automatically and starts working.

![Kanban workflow](public/screenshots/kanban-diagram.png)

Queue 10 tasks, walk away, come back to all of them done. Cards can run **in parallel** (independent tasks) or **sequentially** (linked sessions, so Claude remembers what the previous task built).

![Kanban screenshot](public/screenshots/03-kanban.png)

### ⚡ Slash commands — your personal shortcuts

Type `/` in the chat input and a menu appears with your saved prompts. Pick one, hit Enter.

Instead of typing "Do a thorough code review: readability, performance, security, and adherence to best practices. Point out issues with severity levels" every time — you just type `/review`.

**8 commands ready out of the box:**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/check` | Check syntax, logic, edge cases, and bugs step by step |
| `/review` | Full code review with severity levels (critical / warning / suggestion) |
| `/fix` | Find the bug, fix it, explain what changed |
| `/explain` | Explain the code clearly with examples |
| `/refactor` | Clean up the code, keep the same behavior |
| `/test` | Write tests: happy path, edge cases, error scenarios |
| `/docs` | Write documentation with examples and gotchas |
| `/optimize` | Find bottlenecks, propose improvements, estimate gains |

Add your own, edit them, delete them. As many as you want.

### 📱 Telegram Bot — Control Claude from Your Phone

Your laptop is closed. You're at the gym, in a meeting, across the world. But your AI is still working. And now — so are you.

Pair your phone with Claude Code Studio in 30 seconds (6-character code from Settings), and your phone becomes a full remote control:

**Queue & Monitor**
- `/projects` — browse all your sessions
- `/chats` — pick up where you left off
- `/chat` — start a new session right now
- `/tasks` — see your Kanban board. Which tasks are running? Which are done?

**See Results Instantly**
- `/last` — show Claude's last action (code written, tests run, files changed)
- `/full` — get the complete output of the last task
- **Kanban task notifications** — your phone buzzes when each queued task finishes or fails, with the task name, status, and how long it took. No more checking the browser to see if it's done.

**Manage on the Go**
- `/files`, `/cat` — browse project files and peek at code without opening an editor
- `/diff` — see exactly what changed in the last commit
- `/log` — recent git history — who changed what, and when
- `/tunnel` — start or stop Remote Access right from your phone (also available as a button in the main menu)
- `/url` — get the current public URL
- `/new` — start a new task queue
- `/stop` — stop a running task

**Claude Asks — You Answer from Your Phone**
Claude sometimes needs your input mid-task: "Should I refactor this function or rewrite it?" With ask_user forwarding, these questions appear instantly in Telegram as inline buttons. Tap your choice, or type a free-text answer — Claude gets it immediately and keeps working. No need to open the browser. You stay in the loop without breaking your flow.

**Inline Stop — One Tap to Cancel**
Every progress message in Telegram has a built-in [🛑 Stop] button. See Claude going in the wrong direction? Tap it. No commands to type, no menus to navigate — the button is right there, on every "Processing..." update. Combined with [🏠 Menu], you always have full control at your fingertips.

**Send Messages, Get Answers Instantly**
Type a message to Claude directly from Telegram. You see a real-time typing indicator while Claude thinks, and the response streams back to both your phone AND your browser simultaneously. The conversation is unified — continue in Telegram, pick it up on your laptop five minutes later, everything is there. And it works both ways: messages sent from Telegram appear in the web UI in real-time too.

**Multi-Device Pairing**
Pair your phone, your tablet, your laptop — all at once. Control the same Claude Code Studio instance from anywhere. Each device gets push notifications when tasks finish, with inline buttons: [View Result] [Continue] [Menu].

**Why This Matters**

You queue 10 refactoring tasks at 9pm. Instead of staring at your laptop, you go to the gym. At 10:15pm, your phone buzzes: "Task 3 complete". You tap [View] and see the changes. You add a comment: "Next, add error handling for the network case." Claude gets it immediately and starts task 4. Two hours later, everything is done. You tap [View Final] and review the full output in Telegram before you even sit at your desk.

No laptop required. No constant monitoring. Just work, delegated.

### 👥 Multiple agents working at once

For complex tasks, Claude doesn't work alone. It creates a team of specialized agents, assigns subtasks, and coordinates the work. You see all agents working in parallel, each with its own output stream.

### 🌐 Remote servers over SSH

Add a remote server, create a project pointing to a directory on it, and Claude works there — as if local. Useful for GPU machines, staging environments, or managing a server fleet without SSH sessions.

### 🔗 Remote Access — Open Your Studio to the World

Your Studio runs on `localhost:3000`. But what if you need to access it from a coffee shop, your phone's browser, or share a link with a teammate?

One click. That's it. Open the **Remote Access** panel in the sidebar, pick a provider — **cloudflared** (no signup, works instantly) or **ngrok** (if you already use it) — and hit Start. You get a public HTTPS URL in seconds.

- **Zero configuration** — cloudflared needs no account, no token, no DNS setup
- **Secure by default** — your Studio password protects everything, the tunnel is just a pipe
- **Telegram integration** — the URL is sent straight to your paired Telegram devices with one tap
- **Start and stop from your phone** — `/tunnel` and `/url` commands in the Telegram bot
- **Works behind NAT, firewalls, corporate VPNs** — if your machine has internet, it works

Why does this matter? Because your AI doesn't need to be chained to your desk. Start a batch of tasks at home, grab the URL from Telegram, and check results from anywhere.

### 💾 Everything is saved

Sessions, chats, task history — all stored locally in SQLite. Come back tomorrow, continue exactly where you left off.

---

## Who is it for?

**Individual developers** — manage multiple projects, queue tasks, resume sessions days later without losing context.

**Teams** — shared Claude Code Studio instance with project visibility, Kanban showing what's being worked on, session history as an audit trail.

**System administrators** — manage your server fleet from one browser tab. Delegate routine tasks ("check disk usage and clean logs", "update nginx on all 5 servers and verify"). Run operations in parallel across machines.

**ML / AI engineers** — run Claude on powerful remote GPU servers. Queue training jobs and preprocessing tasks. Check results from your laptop.

---

## What it doesn't do

To be clear about the scope:

- It doesn't add capabilities to Claude Code — it provides an interface for them
- It's not a SaaS — you run it locally, your data stays on your machine
- It doesn't replace your IDE — it manages Claude sessions

This isn't a product trying to lock you in. It's infrastructure you can own.

## Technical details

For developers who want to understand or modify how it works.

### Architecture

Single Node.js process. No build step. No TypeScript. No framework.

```
server.js         — Express HTTP + WebSocket
auth.js           — bcrypt passwords, 32-byte session tokens
claude-cli.js     — spawns `claude` subprocess, parses JSON stream
telegram-bot.js   — Telegram bot: remote control, notifications, session bridge
public/index.html — entire frontend (HTML + CSS + JS in one file)
config.json       — MCP server definitions + skills catalog
data/chats.db     — SQLite: sessions + messages
skills/           — .md skill files loaded into system prompt
workspace/        — Claude's working directory
```

### Environment variables

```env
PORT=3000
WORKDIR=./workspace
MAX_TASK_WORKERS=5
CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000
TRUST_PROXY=false
LOG_LEVEL=info
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # SDK engine only, optional
```

### Two engines

- **CLI engine** — spawns `claude` subprocess. Uses your Claude Max subscription. No API key needed.
- **SDK engine** — calls `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` SDK directly. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### Security

- Passwords: bcrypt, 12 rounds
- Tokens: 32-byte random hex, 30-day TTL, server-side storage
- SSH passwords: AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest
- API keys: never sent to the browser
- Headers: Helmet.js on all responses
- File access: path traversal protection on all file operations

### Development

```bash
npm run dev   # auto-reload (node --watch)
npm start     # production
```
